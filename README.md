# AICodeReviewer
This is a PowerShell script that utilizes Ollama AI to review code and gives feedback. For me it beats the purpose of generating code using Copilot or ChatGPT.

## Features
1. Scans all files in "$currentFolder" from code to documentation.
2. Reads both the code and the docs to generate a better response.
3. Gives a response using the $files and $docs.

## Contribute
If you have any suggestions I would like to hear so in the issues section inside this Github repo.
